Description for governance policies - usable in Domino Governance

## NIST AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) 
[NIST_AIRMF_100_1](NIST_AIRMF_100_1.yaml)

This comprehensive Domino policy operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 by guiding users through ten structured stages—from mapping NIST Core Functions & Categories, selecting Implementation Tiers & Profiles, and assigning governance roles, to planning & design, data collection & processing, model building, verification & validation, deployment, ongoing monitoring, and assessing people & planet impacts—using targeted form inputs that mirror every RMF requirement, with an approver to ensure end-to-end traceability and lock-down upon completion.
